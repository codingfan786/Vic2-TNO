## MP Minimum Roster
For MP the following nation list is the minimum roster you need to play:

- Germany
- RK Moscow

- USA
- N.P.A. (That brown country in Yunnan)
- Russia #1 (Red army Remnants or Committee for the Liberation of Russia)
- Free France (In West Africa. Yes it is viable.)

- Japan

- Italy
- Iberia
- Turkey

After this you may additionally roster:

- South Africa AND Sudwest Afrika
- India AND Thailand
- Romania
- England
- Finland
- Russia #2 (Magadan)
- Nigeria

After this it is also possible to play:
- 4 WAY GERMAN CIVIL WAR! (NOT FUN)
- Kazakhstan
- Afghanistan
- Anyone in the Middle East/Arabia can form the United Arab Republic. Italian Egypt and Levant can rebel form it.
- Brazil I guess

## Proxy War CB
Proxy War CB's are a unique instant CB you can use to intervene in your sphereling's war without risk of losing any land yourself.

For MP the following rules concerning the Proxy War CB are strongly suggested:

- Proxy CB wars should not be surrendered unless pulling out of/surrendering the main war.
For example:
A has sphered B and X has sphered Y.
B and Y are at war.
X declares a proxy war on B using the proxy CB.
A then declares a proxy war on X and a proxy war on Y. 
X cannot surrender the proxy war with A unless also surrendering the proxy war against B.

- Proxy war WS does not count towards any total war score in the case that they are considered merged with the main war or any other war. (The CBs in a proxy war are status quo vs status quo so it doesn't make sense to include those war scores in the actual peace deal.)

- If the main war becomes a great war, then the Proxy Wars should be edited out and all participants merged into the main war as normal participants. 

## Nuclear Ultimatums
Nuclear launches have limited range and can be halted altogether if you are fast enough.
Each level of nuclear devastation on a province gives -0.1% pop growth, up to a maximum of 6 devastation. Only provinces with 100k pops are targeted and the devastation goes down 1 level roughly once a year by random event.

- By default if your entire country is not sieged down by 50% or more you will deal 1 level of devastation everywhere.

If a country (with nukes or proxy sites) owns land in a continent, then their sphere's nuclear strike will count as having range in that continent. If 50% or more of a countries provinces in a continent are sieged down by the time of the strike, then they will not contribute any nuclear range in that continent.

- Having a proxy site country with range in a continent will deal 1 level of devastation to land in neighbouring continents and 2 levels of devastation in the same continent. (These don't stack.)

- Having a nuke possessing country with range in a continent will deal 2 level of devastation to land in neighbouring continents and 3 levels of devastation in the same continent. (These don't stack.)

Proxy sites and regular nuke possession damage will stack together. That means it is possible to deal at most 6 devastation in a single strike (nuclear power has land in continent +3, proxy site has land in continent +2, global nuke hits +1).


### Nuclear Ultimatum in MP
Since the white peace from the ultimatum does not give a truce, in MP you should include a rule that all participants white peaced in an ultimatum must wait the normal truce time to declare war again.

~~The white peace event can arbitrarily end entire wars instead of just peacing out individual participants. I'm not sure how to fix this so the following rule in MP is strongly suggested.~~

- ~~Everyone who has received a nuclear ultimatum event must choose the "stay in war" option. Anyone who wanted to peace out is then given the opportunity to white peace the war using normal peace deals. All spherlings of this person must also be white peaced. (The intented behavior of the nuke mechanic.)~~

I believe the bug this refers to has been fixed and so this rule is no longer necessary.








## MP Roster (Old, you should ignore this)
For MP the following rosterable nation list is suggested:

- Germany (as many as you want to roster)
- USA
- Japan
- Italy

- Iberia
- Turkey
- Romania
- England
- Free France (In West Africa. Yes it is viable.)

- Finland
- RK Moscow
- Russia #1 (Red army Remnants or Committee for the Liberation of Russia)
- Russia #2 (Magadan)

- N.P.A. (That brown country in Yunnan)
- India
- Thailand

- South Africa
- Sudwest Afrika
- Nigeria

Not as important:
- Kazakhstan
- Afghanistan
- Anyone in the Middle East/Arabia can form the United Arab Republic. Italian Egypt and Levant can rebel form it.

If you need to cut countries from the main list I would recommend cutting Nigeria, Free France, Russia #2, and possibly N.P.A. (In that order)
