## MP Roster
For MP the following rosterable nation list is suggested:

- Germany (as many as you want to roster)
- USA
- Japan
- Italy

- Iberia
- Turkey
- Romania
- England
- Free France (In West Africa. Yes it is viable.)

- Finland
- RK Moscow
- Russia #1 (Red army Remnants)
- Russia #2 (Magadan)

- N.P.A. (That brown country in Yunnan)
- India
- Thailand

- South Africa
- Sudwest Afrika
- Nigeria

Not as important:
- Kazakhstan
- Afghanistan
- Anyone in the Middle East/Arabia can form the United Arab Republic. Italian Egypt and Levant can rebel form it.

If you need to cut countries from the main list I would recommend cutting Nigeria, Free France, Russia #2, and possibly N.P.A.

## Proxy War CB
Proxy War CB's are a unique instant CB you can use to intervene in your sphereling's war without risk of losing any land yourself.

For MP the following rules concerning the Proxy War CB are strongly suggested:

- Proxy CB wars should not be surrendered unless pulling out of/surrendering the main war.
For example:
A has sphered B and X has sphered Y.
B and Y are at war.
X declares a proxy war on B using the proxy CB.
A then declares a proxy war on X and a proxy war on Y. 
X cannot surrender the proxy war with A unless also surrendering the proxy war against B.

- Proxy war WS does not count towards any total war score in the case that they are considered merged with the main war or any other war. (The CBs in a proxy war are status quo vs status quo so it doesn't make sense to include those war scores in the actual peace deal.)

- If the main war becomes a great war, then the Proxy Wars should be edited out and all participants merged into the main war as normal participants. 

## Nuclear Ultimatums
Nuclear launches have limited range and can be halted altogether if you are fast enough.

- If someone has nukes at all then all target provinces will receive a Light Nuke modifier.

- If someone with nukes owns land on the same continent as a target province, it will receive a Heavy Nuke modifier.

- If someone with nukes owns land on a neighbouring continent as a target province, it will receive a Medium Nuke modifier.

- If a nuclear proxy owns land on the same continent as a target province, it will receive a Medium Nuke modifier.

- If a nuclear proxy owns land on a neighbouring continent as a target province, it will receive a Light Nuke modifier.

These modifiers will each stack up to 3 times each on a province. The ingame localisation truncates the pop growth penalty number.

- Heavy Nuke modifier gives -0.15% pop growth
- Medium Nuke modifier gives -0.10% pop growth
- Light Nuke modifier gives -0.05% pop growth

If a country has half its provinces sieged down by the end of the 6 month launch countdown, they will not contribute to the nuclear launch.

### Nuclear Ultimatum in MP
~~The white peace event can arbitrarily end entire wars instead of just peacing out individual participants. I'm not sure how to fix this so the following rule in MP is strongly suggested.~~

- ~~Everyone who has received a nuclear ultimatum event must choose the "stay in war" option. Anyone who wanted to peace out is then given the opportunity to white peace the war using normal peace deals. All spherlings of this person must also be white peaced. (The intented behavior of the nuke mechanic.)~~

I believe the bug this refers to has been fixed and so this rule is no longer necessary.
