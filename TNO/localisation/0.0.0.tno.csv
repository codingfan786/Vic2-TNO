They will also get some troops for every province with Open Revolt. The German dictatorships to our north will join the Boers if they have not collapsed before then.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVENT500066;The failure in World War 2 and the economic hardships our loss brought has lead to an increasing poverty gap between the southern and northern regions of our country. The tensions this has caused between the Afro-American and Dixie citizenry will inevitably lead to outright violence in these states. We do however have a chance to soften the impact of this. \n\n Jackson and Washington each start with their own modifiers representing racial tensions and federal desegregation efforts respectively. These will slowly spread throughout the south until every province is covered with one of them, at which point the provinces with racial tensions will fall into anarchy as racial violence erupts until military intervention arrives. \n Having a liberal party slows the spread of racial tension, while having at least 0.5% bureaucrats in a state will slow tension spread and speed up desegregation spread. \n Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

event500199desc;Ever since 1933 the Reichstag Fire Decree has been the symbolic cornerstone of the hardliner National Socialist regime in Germany. The governmental reforms championed by the former Fuhrer Albert Speer have accumulated today into the repealing of the Fire Decree and the further opening of German politics. As a new generation of Speerite reformists dominate the Reich Chancellery, hardliners are left unable to resist the coming tide of democratization.;x
event500200desc;The former Fuhrer Albert Speer has announced his withdrawal from German politics today, citing his advanced age and general health concerns. Fuhrer Speer's policy of limited reform had lead the Reich to a state of relative calm as many previously disenfranchised people are now allowed a meager voice in government affairs. The Reich Chancellery is split evenly between the new generation of reformist National Socialists following in Speer's footsteps and hardliners directly opposed to them.;x
event500201desc;Fuhrer Speer has passed away today following a period of illness onset by his advanced age. He leaves behind a legacy of resolute strength and confidence in the forced labour systems set up during the days of Organisation Todt and World War II. His supporters are well known for their hardliner positions on National Socialism and 'Speerite' economics. Outside observers expect little to change in the German governmental policies.;x
event500202desc;For the student generation of the late 1970's and early 1980's the circumstances that gave rise to support of National Socialism are but a distant memory of two generations ago. The tennants of nationalism and supremacism fall deaf on the ears of this new generation and personal liberty seems to be on the lips of every student in Germania. The widespread unrest and protests have begun and in some cases escalated as certain more radical student groups have formed the 'Rote Armee Fraktion', an organization labeled a communist terrorist organization by Fuhrer Bormann.;x
event500203desc;Reichsminister Walther Hewel has suggested a radical approach of negotiation and appeasement with the student protests surrounding Germania. This would involve Fuhrer Bormann meeting with protest leaders and dicussing many potential avenues of reform and placating them with distant promises. The Abwehr is on high alert and suggests that such actions would lead to Fuhrer Bormann being highly exposed to a possible attack from Rote Armee Fraktion terrorists hiding amongst the student protesters.;x
event500204desc;Tragedy has struck as Fuhrer Bormann is reported dead as a result of health complications from his advanced age. Unconfirmed reports and rumors circulate of murder at the hands of the Rote Armee Fraktion, leading to much concern over the stability of his successors' regime. Fuhrer Bormann's death comes at a critical time as student protests and Rote Armee Fraktion attacks around Germania reach a crescendo.;x
event500205desc;Terror grips the nation as Martin Bormann and many other high ranking National Socialist officials are reported as dead during a widespread series of attacks conducted by the Rote Armee Fraktion.

event500285desc;There's several major events and features in the mod that require some explanation. Most of these occur in the 1970's.;x
event500286desc;The United States has a pseudo-civil war that will peak in the 1970's.\n\nJackson and Washington each start with their own modifiers representing racial tensions and federal desegregation efforts respectively. These will slowly spread throughout the south until every province is covered with one of them, at which point the provinces with racial tensions will get a pop growth penalty to represent the racial violence occuring. This pop growth penalty can be removed early by positioning troops in a province for a few weeks.\n Having a liberal party slows the spread of racial tension, while having at least 0.5% bureaucrats in a state will slow tension spread and speed up desegregation spread.\nAfter the pop growth penalty has been removed from all provinces, the U.S.A. can accept Afro-American culture.;x
event500287desc;The U.S.A. can set up a provisional government mandate in countries they liberate.\n\nThe U.S.A. can choose to spread cores for their O.F.N. Mandate substate to states that have crisis temperature in them. Whenever states with O.F.N. cores are liberated to countries with cores on them (such as either through rebels, a crisis, or liberate CB), the U.S.A. can acquire them for their O.F.N. Mandate substate. Countries can request their cores from the U.S.A. or take them directly from the substate in war.;x
event500288desc;Boer separatists in South Africa will attempt to break away from with the support of the German-African regimes.\n\nAny time a Boer core we own is sieged down by rebels the province will be marked with a modifier named Open Revolt. In the early 1970's (or earlier if all Boer cores are sieged) the Boer republic will declare independence in every state that has a province with Open Revolt. They will also get some troops for every province with Open Revolt. The German dictatorships to our north will join the Boers if they have not collapsed before then. The German-African regimes will gain increasing militancy every 6 months the war lasts if they join.;x
event500289desc;There are a few unique rebel types introduced for larger, complex separatist movements.\n\nThe Iberian Union has Defederalist rebels that lead to the breakup of Portugal, Spain, Catalonia, and Morocco.
