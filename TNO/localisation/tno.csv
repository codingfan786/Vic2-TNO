EVENT500066;The failure in World War 2 and the economic hardships our loss brought has lead to an increasing poverty gap between the southern and northern regions of our country.

We do however have a chance to soften the impact of this. \n\n Jackson and Washington each start with their own modifiers representing racial tensions and federal desegregation efforts respectively. These will slowly spread throughout the south until every province is covered with one of them, at which point the provinces with racial tensions will fall into anarchy as racial violence erupts until military intervention arrives. \n Having a liberal party slows the spread of racial tension, while having at least 0.5% bureaucrats in a state will slow tension spread and speed up desegregation spread. \n Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

By repealing these outdated practices many non-Germans who have been subject to Germanization programs can more easily pass as fully German people.;x

event500182desc;The Wunderwaffen project, revived by Goring to occupy the militarist faction, has returned with a vengeance. The scope has increased drastically, creeping even into the space program. The 'Sun Gun Project', as it's been labeled by the western press, has quickly covered our face with egg and dug a hole in our budget.;x
event500199desc;Ever since 1933 the Reichstag Fire Decree has been the symbolic cornerstone of the hardliner National Socialist regime in Germany. The governmental reforms championed by the former Fuhrer Albert Speer have accumulated today into the repealing of the Fire Decree and the further opening of German politics. As a new generation of Speerite reformists dominate the Reich Chancellery, hardliners are left unable to resist the coming tide of democratization.;x
event500200desc;The former Fuhrer Albert Speer has announced his withdrawal from German politics today, citing his advanced age and general health concerns. Fuhrer Speer's policy of limited reform had lead the Reich to a state of relative calm as many previously disenfranchised people are now allowed a meager voice in government affairs. The Reich Chancellery is split evenly between the new generation of reformist National Socialists following in Speer's footsteps and hardliners directly opposed to them.;x
event500201desc;Fuhrer Speer has passed away today following a period of illness onset by his advanced age. He leaves behind a legacy of resolute strength and confidence in the forced labour systems set up during the days of Organisation Todt and World War II. His supporters are well known for their hardliner positions on National Socialism and 'Speerite' economics. Outside observers expect little to change in the German governmental policies.;x
event500202desc;For the student generation of the late 1970's and early 1980's the circumstances that gave rise to support of National Socialism are but a distant memory of two generations ago. The tennants of nationalism and supremacism fall deaf on the ears of this new generation and personal liberty seems to be on the lips of every student in Germania. The widespread unrest and protests have begun and in some cases escalated as certain more radical student groups have formed the 'Rote Armee Fraktion', an organization labeled a communist terrorist organization by Fuhrer Bormann.;x
event500203desc;Reichsminister Walther Hewel has suggested a radical approach of negotiation and appeasement with the student protests surrounding Germania. This would involve Fuhrer Bormann meeting with protest leaders and dicussing many potential avenues of reform and placating them with distant promises. The Abwehr is on high alert and suggests that such actions would lead to Fuhrer Bormann being highly exposed to a possible attack from Rote Armee Fraktion terrorists hiding amongst the student protesters.;x
event500204desc;Tragedy has struck as Fuhrer Bormann is reported dead as a result of health complications from his advanced age. Unconfirmed reports and rumors circulate of murder at the hands of the Rote Armee Fraktion, leading to much concern over the stability of his successors' regime. Fuhrer Bormann's death comes at a critical time as student protests and Rote Armee Fraktion attacks around Germania reach a crescendo.;x
event500205desc;Terror grips the nation as Martin Bormann and many other high ranking National Socialist officials are reported as dead during a widespread series of attacks conducted by the Rote Armee Fraktion. The events occured during a series of scheduled talks between Bormann and the student protest leaders.

event500233desc;The overwhelming perception of the Malta Conference among Italian Politics is that of utter failure. The lack of proper resolution and the acquiescence of demands to the former Triumvirate members has lead many in the government to doubt the leadership of Il Duce Galeazzo Ciano and to call for a conference in Verona to debate the future of the Italian Empire.\nThe tension in Verona is intense as Il Duce Ciano has to contend with not only his §Rhardliner opponents in the National Fascist Party who have organized themselves into a political faction dubbing themselves the "Quadrumvirate"§!, but also the §Bdemocratic reformist ideals of the Italian monarch King Umberto II §!who has found himself much support in the armed forces and the more pragmatic members of the party. Meanwhile, in the shadows of the conference the Red Brigade organization awaits with baited breath an opportune moment to strike and coup the whole government for their goal of Italian socialist freedom.\n\n\n\n§BTo be more specific: §GIl Duce Ciano must carefully balance the demands of the King and the Quadrumvirate if you want to maintain the current government and party. §RHowever, making too many concessions to one side may bring an end to Italian Fascism!§!\nThere will be three rounds of negotiations during the conference.;x

event500237desc;Il Duce Ciano is no more.
